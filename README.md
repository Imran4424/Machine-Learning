# What is Machine Learning

What we lack in knowledge, we make up for in data

Machine Learning is inferring knowledge from data. **Learning - optimizing a performance criterion.**

**Machine learning is simply programming computers to optimize a performance criteria on using an example data or past experience**

We have a model defined up to some parameters and learning is going to be the execution of a computer program to optimize the parameters of the model using the training data or past experience.

Machine Learning

- Grew out of work in AI
- New Capability for computers

#### Formal Definition

Arthur Samuels Describes **Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.**

#### Machine Learning Examples

- Classifying emails as spam or not spam
- Google Search Engine
- Facebook photo recognization
- Credit Scoring (Determining bank client situation)


# Types and Applications of Machine Learning

There are basically three types of Machine Learning

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

# Artificial Intelligence vs Machine Learning

# Essential mathematics for ML and AI

# Supervised Learning

In supervised Learning, we are going to have

- Inputs
- Outputs
- An Algorithm
  
#### Supervised Learning Examples

- Classifying emails as spam or not spam (Classification problem)
- Handwritten Digit Recognition (Classification problem)

### Classification Problem

In classification problem, we have inputs, an algorithm and outputs.

This output is basically a class.

A lot of these algorithms are going to be defined by the output that they produce.

For classification, we have quality of outputs. This is the Defining feature of classification algorithm.

A classification problem can have multiple classes as outputs depending upon the input dimention.

A use of classification algorithm is **Pattern Recognition**

#### Pattern Recognition problems are

- Optical Character Recognition
- Face recognition
- Medical Diagonosis
- Speech Recognition
- Handwritten Digit recognition

Another use of classification algorithm is **Knowledge Extraction**

#### Knowledge Extraction

Knowledge extraction means learning a rule from data. All of machine learning is really knowledge extraction. However, we are talking about the specific rule that is learned from the past.
