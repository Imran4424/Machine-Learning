# What is Machine Learning

What we lack in knowledge, we make up for in data

Machine Learning is inferring knowledge from data. **Learning - optimizing a performance criterion.**

**Machine learning is simply programming computers to optimize a performance criteria on using an example data or past experience**

We have a model defined up to some parameters and learning is going to be the execution of a computer

Machine Learning

- Grew out of work in AI
