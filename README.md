# What is Machine Learning

What we lack in knowledge, we make up for in data

Machine Learning is inferring knowledge from data. Learning - optimizing a performance criterion.

**Machine learning is simply programming computers to optimize a performance criteria on using an example data or past experience**

We have a model defined up to some parameters and learning is going to be the execution of a computer program to optimize the parameters of the model using the training data or past experience.

Data is really important for machine learning because machine learning relys on past experience.

Machine Learning

- Grew out of work in AI
- New Capability for computers

#### Formal Definition

Arthur Samuels Describes **Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.**

#### Machine Learning Examples

- Classifying emails as spam or not spam
- Google Search Engine
- Facebook photo recognization
- Credit Scoring (Determining bank client situation)

#### Types and Applications of Machine Learning

There are basically three types of Machine Learning

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

# Artificial Intelligence vs Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are technical buzzword now.

But, people often confused about two. They think they are all the same but they are not. There is some difference between artificial intelligence and machine learning.

#### Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence is the theory and development of computer systems that able to perform tasks that normally requires human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision making and translation between languages.

#### Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence.

Arthur Samuels Describes **Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.**

As I said, machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. So let's say it old school way, Every machine learning project or theories are artificial intelligence but every artificial intelligence theories or projects are not machine learning.

Then let's see now, what's not machine learning to better understand the difference.

- Machine learning is not based on logic or rule it is based on statistics
- Machine learning has not understanding of the world
- Machine learning is not study of neuro science

### Essential mathematics for ML and AI

The important mathematics for machine learning and AI are

- Linear Algebra
- Multivariative Calculus
- Probability Theory
- Statistics

# Supervised Learning

In supervised Learning, we are going to have

- Inputs
- Outputs
- An Algorithm
  
#### Supervised Learning Examples

- Classifying emails as spam or not spam (Classification problem)
- Handwritten Digit Recognition (Classification problem)

### Classification Algorithm

In classification problem, we have inputs, an algorithm and outputs.

This output is basically a class.

A lot of these algorithms are going to be defined by the output that they produce.

For classification, we have quality of outputs. This is the Defining feature of classification algorithm.

A classification problem can have multiple classes as outputs depending upon the input dimention.

A use of classification algorithm is **Pattern Recognition**

##### Pattern Recognition problems are

- Optical Character Recognition
- Face recognition
- Medical Diagonosis
- Speech Recognition
- Handwritten Digit recognition

Another use of classification algorithm is **Knowledge Extraction**

##### Knowledge Extraction

Knowledge extraction means learning a rule from data. All of machine learning is really knowledge extraction. However, we are talking about the specific rule that is learned from the past. In this scenario, learned from the past data.

Classification algorithm can also be used in **compression**. Another use of classification algorithm is **outlier detection**

### Regression algorithm

In regress algorithm we have inputs, an algorithm and the outputs.

The output is basically a number. **Quantitative Output**

**Example:** Used car price

# Unsupervised Learning

In unspervised learning we only have input data. We have no label responses for these scenarios.

We only have input data to work with and don't necessarily know what we are looking for. However, we do have a goal. We are going to try to find regularities in the input for unsupervised learning.

We are making an assumption that there is a structure to the input space such that certain pattern occurs more often than the others and we want to see what generally happens and what is not.

In statistics, this is called density estimation. We assume that the input space is structured again as a result certain patterns are going to occur more often than others and we want to look for these patterns so that we can use them in different scenarios.

In machine learning, this is called clustering. The aim is to find clusters or groups of inputs that naturally separate towards each other.

#### Clustering examples

- Clustering customer data
- Document clustering

# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning neither supervised learning nor unsupervised learning.

Reinforcement learning have inputs sometimes which is called observations, we also have algorithm and then we are going to have a sequence of actions. And here, those sequence of actions is called outputs.
     
The outputs here isn't a class, it is numerical but it is going to be combinations of actions that allow us to reach our goal.

#### Example

- Game Playing
- Robot Navigation
